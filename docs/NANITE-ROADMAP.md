# NANITE WORKSTREAM — ROADMAP (the task DAG · READ FIRST on every compact)

## YOU ARE HERE — 2026-06-14
**PERF-1 LANDED (LOG `ay`): per-pass measurement is now TRUSTWORTHY, the PURE nanite
renderer is ISOLATED (`?pure`), and the user's WORST view is decomposed with cool numbers.**
The first real dump exposed two integrity defects + one methodology error, all fixed:
- the harness was LYING — dead-CSM garbage NEGATIVE timestamps poisoned the `render` total
  (−97 ms) so `--gpusample` returned 0 samples; `GpuProfiler` now rejects non-finite/negative.
- `?pure` (master ablation = postmin + nanshadow=0 + nandbg=flat; strips beauty, KEEPS
  geometry) fixes the user's "?pure = zero terrain" (it was never wired) and isolates the floor.
- I'd been measuring bm7 = forest INTERIOR (cheapest view). `probe-worstpos.ts` boots the
  user's worst pos (cam −4.2,303.1,−1.4 @T11) and yaw-sweeps to the "long alley".

**THE FINDING (cool, trustworthy):** worst view = 82k visClusters / 130k hwTris. PURE nanite
SW raster = depth **2.82** + payload **2.95** = **5.77 ms** (+ HW 2.62 + flat resolve 2.10);
**fps 35→95 just by stripping post.** AND the post chain THERMALLY THROTTLES the GPU **~2.1×**
(the SAME raster reads 5.96 ms hot). ⇒ (a) the SW depth+payload raster is the #1 nanite lever;
(b) post throttles nanite on top of its own cost.

**PERF-3 ANALYSIS DONE (LOG `az`):** `nanRasterDepth` per-TRIANGLE bound — makeCtx 0.46 (16%), 3×
fetchWorldVert 1.11 (39%), edge 0.13 (5%), per-pixel loop 1.12 (40%); atomic NOT it (depth≈payload).
**WIN #1 LANDED (LOG `ba`): per-cluster makeCtx CACHE in workgroup shared memory** — 1 workgroup == 1
cluster, so compute makeCtx once (thread 0) + broadcast via `workgroupArray`/`workgroupBarrier`. **−0.59 ms
(−11%)** on the camera SW raster (alternated, bit-identical), default ON (`?wgcache=0` A/Bs); also speeds the
6 shadow rasters. First workgroup-shared-mem use in the codebase.
**→ ACTIVE: PERF-3 win #2 — per-cluster VERTEX-TRANSFORM CACHE via build-time COMPACTION** (user-confirmed
"full compaction straight away"). `?vrange` data: explicit redund 4.13× (95% range ≤128), HF-DAG 3.76× (40%
range >1024) ⇒ runtime range-cache FAILS terrain; workgroup atomics unsupported ⇒ only compaction generalizes
(cache sized by vertCount ≤~190 fits 16 KB shared mem for ALL geo; race-free strided transform, no atomics;
bonus local-index memory win ~−100 MB). DESIGN: PARALLEL `gpu.vcompact` buffer (2 u32/cluster: vertBase,
vertCount; 0 ⇒ per-thread fallback) — NOT a CLUSTER_WORDS change (would shift every ci·8 offset). Gated
`?vcompact`, compacted PER PACK PATH so the kernel handles compacted-or-not per cluster (incremental, always
self-consistent). STAGES: **(1) explicit-path compaction** (contiguous dup verts + indices + vcompact;
fetchWorldVert UNCHANGED ⇒ render BIT-IDENTICAL, no perf yet) → **(2) kernel cooperative transform** (read
vcompact, transform [vertBase,+vertCount) into shared vec3, barrier, tris read shVerts[vi−vertBase]) = the win
→ **(3) extend to attachDag + attachHeightDagTile** (pool caps grow for dup) → **(4) narrow local indices**
(memory). NOTE: the ctx-cache net (−0.59) was below gross — the cooperative transform has the same barrier+
shared-read overhead, so VALIDATE the net win at stage 2 before stages 3–4. Owed: COOLED absolute-ms batch.

## A. MEASUREMENT + CORE RASTER — immediate priority (user 2026-06-14)
| id | task | status | blockedBy | spec | scope (one line) |
|----|------|--------|-----------|------|------|

KEY: post chain THERMALLY THROTTLES nanite ~2.1×. |
| `PERF-2` | Profile pure-nanite floor + worst-view decomp | ✅ | `PERF-1` | LOG `ay`,`az`; PERF LEDGER | DONE (folded) — worst view 82k visCl: SW raster depth 2.82 + payload 2.95 = 5.77ms, HW 2.62, flat resolve 2.10 (cool). SW depth+payload = the #1 nanite cost. |
| `PERF-3` | Depth-rasterizer optimization (shared-mem caches) | 🔵 | `PERF-2` | LOG `az`,`ba`; NaniteRaster | WIN #1 LANDED (`?wgcache` default ON): per-cluster makeCtx cache in workgroup shared mem → **−0.59 ms (−11%)** camera SW raster, bit-identical + alternated, + the 6 shadow rasters. NEXT: the 3× fetchWorldVert (39%) vertex cache — FORK: build-time vert compaction (~1.5–2.5× mem) vs runtime [vMin,vMax] range-cache. |
| `AUDIT-1` | Deviation audit vs original Fable 5 spec | ⬜ | — | PROVENANCE; `reference/fable5-original-NANITE.md` | diff current state/impl vs the 937-line original; flag unjustified drops from my D-N* edits (shadows = D-N29, justified) |

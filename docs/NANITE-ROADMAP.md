## YOU ARE HERE — 2026-06-15
**PERF-4 CLOSED (post chain). PERF-3 CLOSED (win #1 makeCtx cache LIVE −0.59 ms; win #2 vertex cache off, D-N40).**
**THE DEFINITIVE FINDING (LOG bg — high-res GPU-bound ablation, reproduced 2×): AO is ~100% of the real post cost.**
Removing AO alone → frameMs 33.4→25.0; removing ALL post → 33.4→24.9 (3888×2520). So **AO (GTAO march + bilateral
upsample + contact) ≈ the ENTIRE post cost** (~8.4 ms high-res ≈ ~3–4 ms native-equiv); **bloom + TAA + aerial +
clouds + bounce + grade ≈ 0.1 ms COMBINED.** The post passes overlap on the GPU so their encoder wall-spans (bloom
14.8, TAA 14.8, half.mrt 10.5 …) OVERCOUNT ~7× — removing bloom or TAA changes the real frame by ~0 ms.
**PERF-4 outcome:**
- **AO ✅ SHIPPED + PERMANENT** (`1db0bfd`): far-fade early-out (march+upsample) + packed-view-z bilateral +
  samples 6 = the one real post win (~1.5 ms direct), beauty-validated 0.00%. Cleanup (bg): the slower original
  path + ALL A/B flags (`?aocheap`/`?aofar`/`?aodbg`/`?aosamples`) DELETED — the optimized path is now the only path.
- **BLOOM ✅ = NOT optimizable** (drain-bound, resolution-flat at native + GPU-bound; reverted). ~0 ms real.
- **TAA ✅ = measured non-win, REMOVED.** Built the user-sanctioned fork (`LeanTraa.ts`), measured ~0.45 ms native
  (ALU/drain-bound, not fetch-bound), then DELETED in cleanup (bg) — not worth a vendored ~240-line library fork.
- **QUARTER-RES AO: declined by the user** ("call it done" at the current AO).
**KEY MEASUREMENT REALITY (durable, SPEC `## PERF METHODOLOGY`):** per-pass post timestamps are encoder WALL-SPANS
that OVERCOUNT ~7× (the passes overlap on the GPU); headless `frameMs` is rAF-capped at 16.7 ms (go GPU-bound at
3888×2520 for real `Δframe`). ABLATION at high res is the only truth. Tool: `probe-postablate.ts`.
**→ PERF-4 CLOSED. AO was the only real post cost, optimized + shipped; bloom + TAA were measurement mirages
(non-wins, reverted/removed); further post perf would be a beauty-TRADING exercise (declined). NEXT FRONTIER is the
user's call: back to N8 (DAG close — N8-D1e), the shadow S-stack, or the deferred AUDIT-1.**

**PERF-1 (LOG `ay`): per-pass measurement is now TRUSTWORTHY, the PURE nanite
renderer is ISOLATED (`?pure`), and the user's WORST view is decomposed with cool numbers.**
The first real dump exposed two integrity defects + one methodology error, all fixed:
- the harness was LYING — dead-CSM garbage NEGATIVE timestamps poisoned the `render` total
  (−97 ms) so `--gpusample` returned 0 samples; `GpuProfiler` now rejects non-finite/negative.
- `?pure` (master ablation = postmin + nanshadow=0 + nandbg=flat; strips beauty, KEEPS
  geometry) fixes the user's "?pure = zero terrain" (it was never wired) and isolates the floor.
- I'd been measuring bm7 = forest INTERIOR (cheapest view). `probe-worstpos.ts` boots the
  user's worst pos (cam −4.2,303.1,−1.4 @T11) and yaw-sweeps to the "long alley".

**THE FINDING (cool, trustworthy):** worst view = 82k visClusters / 130k hwTris. PURE nanite
SW raster = depth **2.82** + payload **2.95** = **5.77 ms** (+ HW 2.62 + flat resolve 2.10);
**fps 35→95 just by stripping post.** AND the post chain THERMALLY THROTTLES the GPU **~2.1×**
(the SAME raster reads 5.96 ms hot). ⇒ (a) the SW depth+payload raster is the #1 nanite lever;
(b) post throttles nanite on top of its own cost.

**PERF-3 ANALYSIS DONE (LOG `az`):** `nanRasterDepth` per-TRIANGLE bound — makeCtx 0.46 (16%), 3×
fetchWorldVert 1.11 (39%), edge 0.13 (5%), per-pixel loop 1.12 (40%); atomic NOT it (depth≈payload).
**WIN #1 LANDED (LOG `ba`): per-cluster makeCtx CACHE in workgroup shared memory** — 1 workgroup == 1
cluster, so compute makeCtx once (thread 0) + broadcast via `workgroupArray`/`workgroupBarrier`. **−0.59 ms
(−11%)** on the camera SW raster (alternated, bit-identical), default ON (`?wgcache=0` A/Bs); also speeds the
6 shadow rasters. First workgroup-shared-mem use in the codebase.
**→ ACTIVE: PERF-3 win #2 — per-cluster VERTEX-TRANSFORM CACHE via build-time COMPACTION** (user-confirmed
"full compaction straight away"). `?vrange` data: explicit redund 4.13× (95% range ≤128), HF-DAG 3.76× (40%
range >1024) ⇒ runtime range-cache FAILS terrain; workgroup atomics unsupported ⇒ only compaction generalizes
(cache sized by vertCount ≤~190 fits 16 KB shared mem for ALL geo; race-free strided transform, no atomics;
bonus local-index memory win ~−100 MB). DESIGN: PARALLEL `gpu.vcompact` buffer (2 u32/cluster: vertBase,
vertCount; 0 ⇒ per-thread fallback) — NOT a CLUSTER_WORDS change (would shift every ci·8 offset). Gated
`?vcompact`, compacted PER PACK PATH so the kernel handles compacted-or-not per cluster (incremental, always
self-consistent). STAGES: **(1) ✅ DONE (committed):** explicit-path `[vMin,count]` cache — `gpu.vcompact`
buffer + `populateVCompact()` (range over each boot cluster's indices, ≤VCACHE_VERTS=192 → store, else
0=fallback; window-grid + streamed terrain stay 0). Explicit uses the EXISTING tight ranges ⇒ NO duplication
(terrain = the later true-compaction stage). Nothing reads it yet ⇒ render bit-identical, boots clean (87.9k
visCl). **(2) ⬜ NEXT = THE WIN — kernel cooperative transform, gated `?vcompact`. (2a)** refactor NaniteFetch:
extract `fetchWorldVertByIndex(ctx, vi)` + a shared `hfWorld(ctx,sx,sz,skirtDrop)` from `fetchWorldVert`
(window-grid stays inline). BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING — `fetchWorldVert` is shared by resolve/shadow/hzb/raster, so
A/B the DEFAULT path bit-identical (screenshot) before/after the refactor. **(2b)** in NaniteRaster, read
`gpu.vcompact[ci]`→(vMin,count); count>0 ⇒ cooperatively transform [vMin,vMin+count) via
`fetchWorldVertByIndex` into `workgroupArray('vec3', VCACHE_VERTS)` (thread t: vMin+t,+128,…), barrier, tris
read `shVerts[vi−vMin]`; else fall back. Bind `gpu.vcompact` in the RASTER ONLY (conditional — avoids the
resolve 10-buffer ceiling). Validate bit-identical + measure the NET (ctx-cache net was BELOW gross — same
barrier+shared-read overhead, so confirm the win is real). → **(3)** terrain true compaction (duplication +
pool-cap growth) → **(4)** narrow local indices (memory). Owed: COOLED absolute-ms batch.

## A. MEASUREMENT + CORE RASTER — immediate priority (user 2026-06-14)
| id | task | status | blockedBy | spec | scope (one line) |
|----|------|--------|-----------|------|------|
| `PERF-1` | Trustworthy per-pass measurement + `?pure` | ✅ | — | LOG `ay`; GpuProfiler/main.ts | DONE 1f2fdbc — hardened GpuProfiler vs garbage −timestamps (harness was lying: render=−97ms→0 samples); `?pure` master (postmin+nanshadow=0+nandbg=flat, keeps geometry, fixes "?pure=zero terrain"); probe-worstpos.ts. KEY: post chain THERMALLY THROTTLES nanite ~2.1×. |
| `PERF-2` | Profile pure-nanite floor + worst-view decomp | ✅ | `PERF-1` | LOG `ay`,`az`; PERF LEDGER | DONE (folded) — worst view 82k visCl: SW raster depth 2.82 + payload 2.95 = 5.77ms, HW 2.62, flat resolve 2.10 (cool). SW depth+payload = the #1 nanite cost. |
| `PERF-3` | Depth-rasterizer optimization (shared-mem caches) | ✅ | `PERF-2` | LOG `az`,`ba`,`bc`; D-N40; NaniteRaster/VertexCache | CLOSED. WIN #1 LANDED (`?wgcache` default ON): per-cluster makeCtx cache → **−0.59 ms (−11%)** camera SW raster (bit-identical, alternated) + the 6 shadow rasters. WIN #2 (vertex cache) BUILT + MEASURED = marginal/conditional non-win (R≈4.7 vs makeCtx R=128; far-terrain transform texture-cache-absorbed) → kept OFF-by-default, isolated to `NaniteVertexCache.ts`. In-kernel raster wins exhausted. |
| `PERF-4` | Post-chain optimization (the 2.1× thermal throttle) | ✅ CLOSED | `PERF-3` | SPEC `## PERF METHODOLOGY`; LOG bd–bg; PostStack/Gtao | **CLOSED.** DEFINITIVE finding (LOG bg, high-res ablation ×2): **AO ≈ 100% of real post cost; bloom/TAA/aerial/clouds ≈ 0.1 ms combined** (per-pass spans overcount ~7×, the passes overlap). AO ✅ SHIPPED + PERMANENT (`1db0bfd`): early-out + packed-view-z bilateral + samples 6 = ~1.5 ms direct; A/B flags + slower path deleted (bg). BLOOM ✅ = not optimizable (drain, reverted). TAA ✅ = measured non-win (~0.45 ms, ALU-bound), fork removed (bg). Quarter-res AO declined by user. Further post = beauty-trading (declined). |
| `PERF-4-TAA` | TAA resolve fork — built, measured non-win, REMOVED | ✅→deleted | `PERF-4` | LOG bf/bg | **DONE — removed.** Built `LeanTraa.ts` (user-sanctioned fork: subclass + faithful resolve copy, neighborhoods shrunk). Measured ~0.45 ms native (NOT ~3 ms — `TRAANode.resolve` is ALU+drain-bound, not fetch-bound; cutting fetches saves ~0). Deleted in cleanup (bg) — not worth a vendored ~240-line library fork for sub-ms. |
| `AUDIT-1` | Deviation audit vs original Fable 5 spec | ✅ DONE | — | LOG bh; `reference/fable5-original-NANITE.md` | **FAITHFUL.** Core technical contract honored (two-phase occlusion, Option C full-f32 vis-buffer, fixed-point edges, near→HW, HW writes same buffer, registerMesh/bindInstances, wind-phase variation). All deviations D-N*-justified (shadows D-N28/29, black-slate D-N21, terrain-lighting D-N22, velocity D-N16, flat-cut D-N31, terrain-DAG D-N32+). Gaps = unreached phases (N6 partial, N7 deferred by black-slate, N9–N11 pending). ONE drift → `AUDIT-1a`. META: two-frame-vs-main gate re-applies at N7/N10. |
| `AUDIT-1a` | Per-instance TINT drift — ratify or restore (USER CALL) | ⬜ | — | LOG bh; NaniteResolve/NaniteFetch | Orig variation law needs BOTH `tint=slotHash(slot,17/91)` + `windPhase=slotHash(slot,211)` "or migration clones trees (banned)". Impl reproduces the wind phase but NOT the tint — bark hue is per-VERTEX `vdata.x` (shared across a mesh's ~4k instances). Trees vary by pose+wind, not colour. RESTORE = add `slotHash(instId,17/91)` to the bark/deadwood albedo (~few lines), or RATIFY if pose+wind+per-vertex hue reads varied enough. |
